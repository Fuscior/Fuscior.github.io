The goal of this GitPages is to document the design/testing and implamentation of my asigned 3rd year project of a House Alarm, with the goal of acieving the desidered outcome using metiod i have learned through my time in EE_SYS while growing skills to self teach and document the prototyping.

This GitPages is designed with the goal to track and doument my process through the task while having a space where users can easly find all relivent infomation/details & code

My implamentation of GitPages is possible through using [markdown](/https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) code with some added [HTML ](/https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-and-html5-example/) in [obsidion](/https://obsidian.md/) allowing for notes and progess to be easly implamented to GitPages.
